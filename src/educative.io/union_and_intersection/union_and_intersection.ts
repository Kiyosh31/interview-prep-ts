/**
 * Problem Statement
 * Union and intersection are two of the most popular operations which can be performed on data sets.
 * Now, you will be implementing them for linked lists! Letâ€™s take a look at their definitions:
 *
 * Union
 * Given two lists A and B;
 * the union is the list that contains elements or objects that belong to either A, or to B, or to both.
 *
 * Intersection
 * Given two lists A and B, the intersection is the largest list,
 * which contains all the elements that are common to both the sets.
 *
 * Input
 * Two linked lists.
 *
 * Output
 * A list containing the union of the two lists.
 * A list containing the intersection of the two lists.
 *
 * Sample Input
 * list1 = 10->20->80->60
 * list1 = 15->20->30->60->45
 *
 * Sample Output
 * union = 10->20->80->60->15->30->45
 * intersection = 20->60
